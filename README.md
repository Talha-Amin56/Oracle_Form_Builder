## Project Description

This repository contains Oracle Forms and reports built with Oracle Forms Builder. The primary goal is to provide an easy-to-use and customizable framework for building interactive forms for Oracle Database applications. The project focuses on integrating forms with Oracle Database to manage data efficiently, and offers a strong foundation for building enterprise-level applications.

## Features

- **Master-Detail Forms**: Demonstrates the creation of master-detail forms to represent relationships between parent and child records.
- **Triggers**: Includes various triggers (when-new-form-instance, when-button-pressed, etc.) for data validation, form interaction, and workflow automation.
- **Custom Validation**: Implements custom validation rules to ensure the integrity of data being entered into the system.
- **Reports**: Generates interactive reports that pull data from Oracle Database, making it accessible for end-users.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Shows how to use dynamic content in Oracle Forms (e.g., populating fields based on user input or database query results).
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed with a simple and intuitive interface that allows easy navigation and data manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Oracle Forms Builder**: A development environment for creating Oracle Forms.
- **PL/SQL**: Used for writing triggers, validations, and other logic for database interaction.
- **Oracle Database**: All forms are designed to interact with an Oracle Database to store and retrieve data.
- **Oracle Reports**: For creating and generating reports from the data.


   
2. **Set Up Your Oracle Database**
   - This project is built to interact with Oracle Database. You need to have access to an Oracle Database instance.
   - Update the **TNS** entries to connect your Forms to the database. You can modify the TNS entries in the `tnsnames.ora` file if needed.
